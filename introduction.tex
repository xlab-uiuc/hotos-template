\section{Introduction}

According to DBLP~\cite{dblp_hotos}, HotOS can be traced back to WWOS (Workshop On Workstation Operating Systems). DBLP does not have information of the first WWOS. The second WWOS was held in September 1989 at Pacific Grove, CA, in which Mach~\cite{Rashid:1989}, Sprite~\cite{Welch:1989}, and Coda~\cite{Satya:1989} were discussed along many other influential works.\footnote{Consider taking CS 523~\cite{cs523} if you are interested in those systems.}
